# Part 5: Providing Project Ideas (1 points)
#
# * Objective:
#   Provide draft project ideas in order to form teams.
# * Details:
#   * This part ensures student start putting time to brainstorm their
#     (mid-term) projects.
#   * Your submission should include three project ideas based on the
#     topics that are covered in the first half of this course:
#     * Data Representation and Errors
#     * Numerical Linear Algebra
#     * Fourier Transform and Spectral Analysis
#     * Interpolation and Extrapolation
#     * Numerical and Automatic Derivatives
#     * Numerical Integration of Functions
#     * Root Finding and Optimization Methods
#     * ODE Integrators
#     * PDE Solvers
#   * You submission will be a well formatted YAML file `hw1/p5.yaml`.
#
# About YAML:
# * YAML (short for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable
#   format for data storage and configuration.
# * YAML uses Python-style indentation for nesting and avoids the use
#   of extraneous characters, making it easy to read.
# * Comments in YAML start with `#` and continue until the end of the line.
#
# Submission Requirement:
# * Your submission must be a valid YAML file that can be read by Python.
# * It should contain a list of three dictionaries, each with the following keys:
#   * "topic": Choose one of the topics listed above.
#   * "idea": Provide a short, clear, and concise description of your project idea.
#
# Below is a sample project idea.

# TODO: Edit this sample idea.

- topic: Root Finding and Optimization Methods
  idea:  Mirage at Speedway Blvd: model the temperature and pressure
         distribution of the air above hot asphalt in summer, then trace
         car headlights by solving ODEs and using root-finding to
         simulate the mirage effect, optionally validating against
         real observations.
         
- topic: PDE Solvers
  idea:  PINN vs. traditional PDE solvers: compare computational
         performance and accuracy of physics-informed neural networks
         (PINNs) against classical numerical solvers.
         
- topic: Fourier Transform and Spectral Analysis
  idea:   Analyze periodicity of the phase-resolved light curve of a
         white dwarfâ€“brown dwarf binary. Measure rotation period and
         phase shifts in different wavelength bins, and apply PCA to
         separate the WD and BD signals.
  
# TODO: Add two more project ideas below, following the same format as
# the example above.
# Remember to ensure that each idea is distinct and concise, and each
# "topic" must be one of the listed course topics.
